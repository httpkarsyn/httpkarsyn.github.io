      if that's what you expect me to say, you're wrong. <br>
      our relationship meant nothing to me. <br>

      and to be honest, <br>
      i hated you. <br>
      i would be lying to myself if i said, <br>
      i want to talk to you. <br>
      why is everything so different now? <br>
      you might have an answer to share. <br>

      leave. </p>
