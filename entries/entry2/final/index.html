    <p class="line">i realized we werent meant to be</p>
    <p class="line">one year before we went our separate ways</p>
    <p class="line">but, thats how long</p>
    <p class="line">i tried to change the ending.</p>
    <p class="line">i poured love into us,</p>
    <p class="line">tried to tip the scales in our favor,</p>
    <p class="line">said, look at all these wonderful things about us.</p>
    <p class="line">look at how we laugh at all the same jokes</p>
    <p class="line">look at how we try to love one another</p>
    <p class="line">and how we want the best for each other:</p>
    <p class="line">fate shook her head, took my hand in hers and said-</p>
    <p class="line">but look at how youre straining in your own skin,</p>
    <p class="line">look at how you bite your tongue everyday,</p>
    <p class="line">look at all the distance thats already there,</p>
    <p class="line">look at how it grows.</p>
    <p class="line">but we love each other, i said.</p>
    <p class="line">fate sighed,</p>
    <p class="line">my dear,</p>
    <p class="line">no amount of love</p>
    <p class="line">can make two mismatched pieces fit together</p>
    <p class="line">not unless,</p>
    <p class="line">you mutilate them into something they never were.</p>
