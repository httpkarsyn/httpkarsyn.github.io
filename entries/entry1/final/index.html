     <h1>when they're no longer right for you,</h1>
        <p>It'll feel wrong most of the time,</p>
        <p>like an incessant ache in your heart,</p>
        <p>you'll notice yourself change.</p>
        <p>Your spirit shrinks,</p>
        <p>your sparkle dulls,</p>
        <p>and you find yourself faking a smile.</p>
        <p>It's often subtle how being with the wrong person</p>
        <p>makes you feel less like yourself,</p>
        <p>and may lead you to seek validation from them</p>
        <p>that you are enough.</p>
